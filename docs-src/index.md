# Extract Schema from Postgres Database

Reads various metadata from your postgres database and returns a js object.
This package is used by [Kanel](https://github.com/kristiandupont/kanel) to generate Typescript types and [Schemalint](https://github.com/kristiandupont/schemalint) to provide linting of database schemas.

## Installation

```bash
npm i extract-pg-schema
```

## Library Usage

You give it a [postgres connection config object](https://node-postgres.com/apis/client) and some options and it will connect to your database and generate

```javascript
const { extractSchemas } = require("extract-pg-schema");

async function run() {
  const connection = {
    host: "localhost",
    database: "postgres",
    user: "postgres",
    password: "postgres",
  };

  const result = await extractSchemas(connection);

  console.log(result);
}

run();
```

The generated output is a record of schemas, described with the [Schema](/api/extract-pg-schema.schema.html) type.

## pglite

The `connection` parameter can either be an object like shown above or a connection string. If the connection string starts with "file:" the specified path is opened using pglite. For example, when providing `file:my/pglite/db/folder`, the folder `'my/pglite/db/folder'` is opened using pglite.

## CLI Usage

You can also use the CLI to extract the schemas from a database and write it to the console or a file in JSON format.

```bash
npx extract-pg-schema -h localhost -p 5432 -U postgres -d postgres > schemas.json
```

The CLI takes a small subset of the options that [pg_dump](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgdump.html) takes. You can also use the [environment variables](https://node-postgres.com/features/connecting#environment-variables) starting with `PG` to set the connection parameters.

```
